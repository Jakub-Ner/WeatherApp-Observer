1. **Central System** every 5 seconds:
  - gets measurements from sensors from all locations
  - sends those to the users
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. **User App**, which is extended by the Menu lets you:
  - display locations
  - display your measurements
  - subscribe new location
  - unsubscribe location
  - Log out
  - turn off the program
